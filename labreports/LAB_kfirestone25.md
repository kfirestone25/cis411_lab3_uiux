## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| CareerBuilder https://www.careerbuilder.com/ | Score 1 | Summary 1 |
| Site 2 | Score 2 | Summary 2 |

## 2.2 Site 1

![Creating Account](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=918&h=447)

1. To create my account, the site needed minimal information from me. By uploading by resume, the website was able to automatically fill out my work history and educational background. 

![Career Goals](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=918&h=420)

2. After creating my account, I was given the option to provide some career goals including desired job title, location, salary, etc. By doing so, the site would ideally be able to better tailor my job search to better fit me. Since I did not have a particular number in mind when it came to desired salary, the site allowed me to leave it blank, which was very helpful. 

![My Profile](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=660&h=323)

3. The site provides a dashboard that contains useful and helpful information such as recommended jobs, profile views, number of applied jobs, etc. 

![Searching for Jobs](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=855&h=417)

4. Searching for a job was surprisingly complicated. Instead of providing a search bar, the site instead opens to this overwhelming screen with hundreds of links.

5. Since I entered my desired location in the "Career Goals" section of the sign-up process, I thought that the site was going to tailor the job search experience for me. However, it provided me with Data Analyst job opportunities all over the United States. Beyond that, I could not find a button that would allow me to sort or filter the jobs by location. 

![Applying for Jobs](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=847&h=324)

6. Although searching for the jobs was more complicated than it needed to be, the site does offer a "One-Click Easy Apply." This basically means that the site is able to automatically put in an application for you if you have previously uploaded your resume. This is a huge time-saver and excellent feature.
